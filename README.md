# Comments
lf: you will learn basic rocq (induction), proof objects, simple imperative programs
plf: you will learn more tactics, hoare logic, small-step semantics, type systems and proofs of type safety
vfa: you will learn algorithms (insertion sort) and data structures (search trees, red-black trees) in rocq and their correctness proofs. you will also learn extraction of ocaml programs from rocq developments. you will learn automation of proofs using match goal.
